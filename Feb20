Good Evening! My name is Rabbi Mendel Zirkind, I currently live in Philadelphia, PA with my wife Mussia. I proposed to her on September 22, 2019, got traditionally engaged on September 25, 2019 & we got married on January 2, 2020. This was the last big wedding for many of our friends/relatives. We went on our first major post wedding trip on March 16, 2020 to London, UK, & returned on March 20, 2020.
